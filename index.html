                    <h2>What is Kpop?</h2>
                    <p>Kpop is Korean popular music. It is mainstream music that originated from <strong>South Korea</strong>. You may see the Korean pop written as K-pop, K pop, Kpop, K-Pop, and KPOP. The term Kpop includes many different musical <em>genres</em>. Along with Korean pop, it can also include <strong>rock</strong>, <strong>hip hop</strong>, and <strong>electronic music</strong>. Kpop is considered a fairly new form of music. The type of K-Pop music that you’re listening to today was formed around the 1990s. The roots for K-Pop began from the 1950s, however, and have since then already been influenced a lot by different types of Western music and pop groups. American pop culture has especially had – and still does have – an effect on K-Pop.

                <h2>What are Kpop idols?</h2>   
                <p>Kpop idols are groups and artists formed by the various entertainment companies creating catchy Korean popular music and targeting younger audiences. The music groups are formed from a group of people who are all particularly talented in at least one of the following: <strong>singing</strong>, <strong>rapping</strong> and <strong>dancing</strong>. These idols often enter the entertainment company in their teens and then train hard for years in areas like singing, rapping, dancing and foreign languages.<br>
                Then, if they are lucky and talented enough, by the end of their teens they will be picked for an idol group. The Kpop groups then periodically come out with music singles and albums filled with catchy tunes. Every week they’ll go to many <strong>music shows</strong> to perform their lead single, for a period of one month to two months. Although the song is important, special care and attention are always put into styling the group members, a <em>well-synched</em> choreography, and a <em>high-quality</em> music video. This combination tells the story of the chosen style <strong>concept</strong> for each era.
